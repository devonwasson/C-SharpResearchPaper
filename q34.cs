Does C# have garbage collection?
Yes, C# does have garbage collection. It is automatic so you do not have to access it yourself.  This means you can develop without having to worry about deallocation of memory. All objects are managed efficiently. Objects that are no longer being used are reclaimed and their spaces freed, and it provides memory safety by “making sure that an object cannot use the content of another object.”
