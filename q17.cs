//q17 -> regular expression support in a library? Java has a regular expression library (so does Python).

Regular Expressions can be implimented in C# with a .NET library. It can be used
to parse through text and find character patterns, as one would expect. It can
also extract, edit, replace, or delete text substrings. (source)

To use RegEx, you define the pattern you want to identify using the syntax
documented in source2, then call a method that performs one of the above operations.
